# Portfolio Website Development Instructions

This is a modern student portfolio website built with HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. The project focuses on creating a responsive, accessible, and visually appealing portfolio landing page.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` - Main HTML file with semantic structure
- `css/style.css` - Modern CSS with CSS Grid, Flexbox, and animations
- `js/script.js` - Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity and animations
- `images/` - Placeholder directory for portfolio images

## Design Principles
- **Mobile-first responsive design** - All components should work on mobile devices first
- **Modern CSS features** - Use CSS Grid, Flexbox, CSS variables, and modern selectors
- **Accessibility** - Include proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation
- **Performance** - Optimize for fast loading and smooth animations
- **Cross-browser compatibility** - Support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<section>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, etc.)
- Follow BEM naming convention for CSS classes when applicable
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
- Write vanilla JavaScript (no external libraries except for icons and fonts)
- Include proper error handling and graceful degradation
- Add meaningful comments for complex functionality

## Key Features
- Responsive navigation with mobile hamburger menu
- Smooth scrolling and scroll animations
- Contact form with validation
- Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations
- Counter animations for statistics
- Parallax effects
- Dark/light theme toggle capability
- Performance optimizations (throttling, lazy loading)

## Customization Guidelines
- Update personal information in HTML content
- Replace placeholder images with actual portfolio images
- Modify color scheme using CSS custom properties
- Add new sections following the existing pattern
- Extend JavaScript functionality as needed

## Best Practices
- Always test responsive design on multiple screen sizes
- Ensure all interactive elements have proper hover/focus states
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography throughout
- Use meaningful alt text for images
- Include loading states for dynamic content
- Follow web accessibility guidelines (WCAG)

When making changes or additions, maintain the existing code quality and follow these established patterns.
